Take a pause
============

Take a pause is a simple Mac OS X application that reminds (and optionally forces) you to take a pause at regular intervals while working.

It is fully configurable and allows you to customize:

* The working interval.
* The pause interval.
* Whether or not you are allowed to postpone the pause and for how long.
* Whether or not you are allowed to give up the pause.
* Whether or not it should consider long idle time as a pause, and restart automatically the countdown for the next pause.

Note: I don't have a Mac anymore, so I am unable to test if the source code is still loadable/buildable with the new versions of XCode.
